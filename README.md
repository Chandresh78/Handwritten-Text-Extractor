# Handwritten Text Extractor

This project is a web application called **Handwritten Text Extractor** that extracts handwritten text from images using EasyOCR. The application is built with Flask.

## Features

- Upload an image file and extract handwritten text.
- Preprocess images to improve OCR accuracy.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtualenv (optional, but recommended)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-text-extractor.git
cd handwritten-text-extractor
```

### Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required packages:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application
